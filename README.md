# E_cells_2023
Code used for analyzing behavioral data and voltage imaging data from Brown et al., 2023.

## Dusk_behavior_suite

This is simple R code written for use with Rethomics to easily analyze multiple behavioral parameters surrounding dusk in the DAM system.

## mVoltron_spikesquant

This is code written to visualize and quantify voltage imaging data. This code analyzes .nd2 files recorded from Nikon cameras. 
It motion corrects the file, corrects for photobleaching, approximates baseline fluorescence, identifies spikes, and counts them.

This code is not perfect and may need some hand-correcting.
