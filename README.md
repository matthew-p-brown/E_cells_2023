# E_cells_2023
Code used for analyzing behavioral data and voltage imaging data from Brown et al., 2023.

## Dusk_behavior_suite

This is simple R code written for use with Rethomics to easily analyze multiple behavioral parameters surrounding dusk in the DAM system.

## mVoltron_spikesquant

This is code written to visualize and quantify voltage imaging data. This code analyzes .nd2 files recorded from Nikon cameras. 
It motion corrects the file using NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017), corrects for photobleaching, visualizes the trace, and exports the mean fluorescence values from the trace as a .csv file.

## spikepursuit_and_spike_analysis

This code is written to do automated spike annotation from voltage imaging traces generated by mVoltron MATLAB code. If attempting to use this code for other datasets, it is important to always verify spike identification by eye.
